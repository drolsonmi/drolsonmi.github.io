# Spam Detection: Naive Bayes vs SVM

## Overview

Students will:
1. Load a spam email dataset (1000 emails, 10 features)
2. Train a **Naive Bayes** classifier
3. Train a **k-Nearest Neighbors** classifier
4. Train an **SVM** classifier
5. Compare the results

**Time Required:** 3-5 hours

## Key Concepts

### Naive Bayes
- **Type:** Probabilistic classifier
- **Assumption:** Features are independent
- **Pros:** Fast, simple, works well with limited data
- **Cons:** Independence assumption rarely holds

### k-Nearest Neighbors
- **Type:** Instance-based/lazy learner
- **Assumption:** Similar data points belong to the same class
- **Pros:** Simple, no training phase, works well with irregular decision boundaries, naturally handles multi-class
- **Cons:** Slow predictions, sensitive to irrelevant features, requires feature scaling, memory intensive (stores all training data)

### SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- **Type:** Margin-based classifier
- **Goal:** Find optimal hyperplane separating classes
- **Pros:** Effective, handles non-linear data (with kernels)
- **Cons:** Requires feature scaling, slower training

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness
- **Precision:** Of predicted spam, how many were actually spam?
- **Recall:** Of actual spam, how many did we catch?
- **F1-Score:** Balance between precision and recall

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Can't import sklearn
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

**Problem:** Kernel keeps dying
- Reduce dataset size
- Close other programs
- Restart Jupyter

**Problem:** Different results each time
- Check that `random_state=42` is set everywhere

## Tips

1. **Run cells in order** - Don't skip ahead
2. **Read error messages** - They usually tell you what's wrong
3. **Compare your metrics** - Both models should work reasonably well
4. **Think about the questions** - There's no single "right" answer
